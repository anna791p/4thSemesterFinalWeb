            <h2> Who are we? </h2>
            <p> GreenKayak is an environmental initiative, which aims to reduce the amount of waste in the water.</p>
            <p>The main activity is to offer volunteers a free trip in our GreenKayaks, in return for collecting waste from the ocean.</p>
            <p>During the last two years, several thousand volunteers used a GreenKayak in the harbours of Denmark, collecting more than 10 tons of waste.</p>

        <h3>Together, we can paddle for the oceans.</h3>

        <div>
            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>With your help, we can remove tons of pollution from the water. In the last two years you've removed over 10 tons from the ocean. Can we beat it this year?</p>
